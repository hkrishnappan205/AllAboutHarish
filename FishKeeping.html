<p class = "main">One of the things that I like to do in my free time is to take care of my aquarium. I have a 50 gallon fishtank at my house and over 15 different species of fish in it. I mostly have freshwater fish in my aquarium ranging from Dwarf Gouramis to Clown Loaches. In my fishtank I have fish of all colors of the rainbow. My fishtank is pretty colorful and neat. I also like to aquascape my fishtank, which is designing my fish tank with differnt kinds of plants and decorations. One of my favorite aquarium decorations is a litte red volcano bubbler, which produces tiny bubbles in the aquarium to make it look like a real volcano. I also have real freshwater plants, like moss and lilies, in my fishtank. I have some cool fish in my aquarium, like Gouramis, Clown Loaches, Giant Dainos, Glofish, and a lot more. I really enjoy watching the fish in my aquarium swim. The fish in my aquarium are very beautifual to watch, and it helps me relax. Almost everyone i've met so far, has complemented me on my fishtank. I also have colored lights on my aquarium to make the aquarium pop out and enchance my fish. I also really love feeding my fish becuase whenever I open the feeding tab on my fishtank, all of my fish swim up to the top to eat the food. I also really like how all my fish are different colors and how my fishtank is full of colors. I really enjoy watching the fish and taking care of them, its very relaing and calm. I spend a lot of time taking care of my fish and making sure that they are as healthy as they can be. I really enjoy fishkeeping, and someday I hope to also have a saltwater aquarium. FishKeeping is one of my favorite hobbies.</P>
