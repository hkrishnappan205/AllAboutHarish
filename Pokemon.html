<p class = "main">One more hobby that I enjoy is Pokemon. When I was a little kid, I would always be collecting Pokemon cards and watching the Pokemon anime. I still like Pokemon and I have a huge collection of Pokemon cards. I have more than a thousand Pokemon cards. As a kid, I would also trade Pokemon cards and battle my friends using Pokemon cards. I also liked watching the Pokemon anime. The Pokemon anime was really interesting and funny. When I was a kid I would also play Pokemon games on the Ds. I would buy the game when it first released and then finish it within a week. I would also go against my brother in Pokemon battles. I have almost all the Pokemon games that have ever released. I currently have the Pokemon Lets Go Evee game on the Nintendo Switch. I used to be a huge fan of Pokemon. My favorite Pokemon was Charizard, and I would always use him during Pokemon games. I also liked to trade Pokemon cards with my friends. When I was a little kid, I would constantlty trade Pokemon cards and battle with my friends. Pokemon was basically my childhood, and I still love Pokemon. I know all the 807 Pokemon and their evolutions.  When I was a child, I even had Pokemon shirts and shoes. I loved Pokemon and I still constantlty keep up with Pokemon. There currently is a new Pokemon game coming out in November, and I'm planning to purchase that Pokemon game too. I still have my Pokemon cards, and they are still in pretty good condition. My favorite Pokemon trainer was Blue, and I also loved to read the Pokemon Manga. When I was a little kid, I would basically be addicted to reading the Pokemon Manga.     </P>
