<p class = "main">Another one of my hobbies is basketball. I love to play and watch basketball with my brother. Right after me and my brother come home from school, we both go to the drive way and play basketball. We both shoot some hoops and whoever makes it to 15 points first, ends up winning. (Usually I end up winning against my brother 15-7) Me and my brother love playing basketball, and we play basketball almost everyday. When it's winter in Omaha, me and my brother usually play NBA 2k after school. He always chooses the Chicago Bulls and I always chose the Boston Celtics. My and my brother are really big fans on 2k, and we play it almost all the time. I also like to watch NBA games on tv. Sometimes my brother and I even make bets to see what team would and what team would lose. My favorite team is the Boston Celtics, and my favorite player is Kawhi Leonard. I also really liked the Space Jam movie with Michael Jordan. Also once a year, my family goes out NBA stadiums to watch NBA games in person. I love going to the NBA stadiums becuase the energy is unbelieveable there and it's really fun to see the NBA players play in real life. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved the basketball and the NBA. When I was in middle school, I would even play basketball for the YMCA. Me and my friends would be on the same team and we would compete against other teams. I usually played the forward or center position. Every since I was a kid, I've loved basketball. I love playing basketball, playing NBA 2k, and watching basketball games. In the future I hope to go to more NBA games in person and witness the players play. </P>
